## 📁 What's Here

This directory contains **internal analysis and development documents** that provide deep insights into the codebase architecture, design decisions, and refactoring work.

### Documents

| Document | Purpose | Audience |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **[ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md)** | Comprehensive codebase analysis with strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations | Developers, Contributors |
| **[CONFIG_SYSTEM_BENEFITS.md](CONFIG_SYSTEM_BENEFITS.md)** | Deep dive into the Pydantic config system benefits across the repo | Developers |

## 🎯 Who Should Read These?

### If you're...

- **Contributing code** → Start with ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md to understand the design
- **Extending the framework** → Read CONFIG_SYSTEM_BENEFITS.md and REFACTOR_COMPLETE.md
- **Understanding design decisions** → All three docs provide context
- **Just using RAGiCamp** → You probably don't need these! Check the main docs instead
