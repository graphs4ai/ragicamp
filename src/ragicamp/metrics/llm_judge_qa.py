"""Enhanced LLM-as-a-judge for QA evaluation with categorical judgments.

This module provides async-capable LLM-as-a-judge metrics for evaluating
QA systems. Uses parallel async API calls for efficient batch evaluation.

Example:
    >>> from ragicamp.models import OpenAIModel
    >>> from ragicamp.metrics import LLMJudgeQAMetric
    >>>
    >>> judge = OpenAIModel("gpt-4o-mini")
    >>> metric = LLMJudgeQAMetric(judge_model=judge, judgment_type="binary")
    >>>
    >>> # Sync usage (internally uses async)
    >>> scores = metric.compute(predictions, references, questions)
    >>>
    >>> # Async usage (for integration with async pipelines)
    >>> scores = await metric.acompute(predictions, references, questions)
